    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>While English classes at IU date back to 1829, it was not until the 1840s that the department began to specialize in classical languages and literatures. In 1861, department chair Henry Bascom Hibbens left to join the Union Army, and the department lacked a central figure until 1868 when George Washington Hoss became the new chairman. Hoss made some significant changes, most notably adding English to the catalogue as an elective (it would not be until 1880 that Chairman Orrin Benner Clark listed courses in the catalogue under the heading "Department of English.") In addition to expanding the curriculum, Clark introduced a written exercise for all IU students and placed an emphasis on literature. Seven years later, in 1887, the department awarded its first M.A. degree.</p><p> In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Clark's successor Martin Wright Sampson expanded the emphasis on literature to include literary history and critical study. Sampson also turned his attention to high schools and raised awareness that incoming freshman needed established writing and literary skills to succeed at IU.</p><p> By 1899, the English Department contained eight of the university's seventy-one faculty members. In 1908, the department offered its first graduate courses, and six years later it granted its first Ph.D. to Lillian B. Brownsfield (ten years later, Sister Gertrude Smith would receive the second Ph.D. awarded by the department). In 1920, following the resignation of numerous faculty and staff members, the English Department took on a new face as a younger generation of teachers entered the department and by 1921 it had expanded to 24 faculty members. For the next twenty-five years, while the department continued to grow, it experienced a period of relative stability while focusing on the teaching of composition and literary history.</p><p> Though the English Department experienced a slight reduction of students during World War II, the department reasserted itself after the war, under the chairmanship of James A. Work (1951-1961), by establishing a variety of outreach programs, such as the Writing Laboratory and a Poetry Series sponsored by Indiana University Press. By revising the undergraduate and honors programs in 1953, Work helped gain national recognition for the department. The graduate program was revised in 1961. In the 1960s the department implemented other programs, such as an English language program for undergraduates in 1966 and a guest speaker seminar series in 1968. In the 1970s, the English Department added a Comparative Literature Program.</p><p> Currently, the English Department has approximately 60 faculty members, 200 graduate students, and 500 undergraduate majors.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The English Department records span the period from 1886 and 2012 with the bulk of the material created in the period from 1940 to 1980. The records are organized into three series: Correspondence, Administrative files, and Publications.</p><p> The Correspondence series contains two sub-series: General correspondence, and Student correspondence. Since most of the correspondence was written to and from English department chairs, the folders have been organized by the person writing to the chairman or to whom the chairman addressed his letter. The <emph render="bold">General correspondence sub-series, 1922-1971, </emph> consists of correspondence from faculty at IU, faculty members from institutions throughout the United States and other countries, prospective and current students, alumni, and individuals associated with various businesses. The <emph render="bold">Student correspondence sub-series, 1924-1964, </emph> is comprised of letters to and from prospective and current students as well as alumni. In the original accession, these files were kept separate from the general correspondence, so the original order has been maintained. Correspondents who wrote or received more than two letters have been placed in their own folder, while the remaining correspondents have been placed in "General" folders located at the end of the appropriate alphabetical section. All the folders in the sub-series are arranged alphabetically by the last name of the correspondent and then chronologically within the folder. Nicknames have been placed in parenthesis after the correspondent's name.</p><p> While most individual folders contain only a few pieces of correspondence, the acting chairman frequently corresponded with several IU faculty and administrators, such as the Dean of Men, C.E. Edmonson, the Dean of the School of Music, Wilfred C. Bain, Professor Edgar L. Yeager of the Psychology Department, Professor Norman Pratt, Jr. of the Classics Department, and Professor Bert E. Young of the Romance Language Department. The acting chairman also recurrently corresponded with faculty and administrative members at other institutions, such as Professor R.W. Pence of DePauw University and Alfred H. Upham, President of the University of Idaho and Miami University (Oxford, OH).</p><p> The Administrative files series contains four sub-series: Committees; General subject; Programs; and Regional campuses. These sub-series have been arranged alphabetically by subject and then chronologically within the folder. The <emph render="bold">Committees sub-series, 1953-1999, </emph>primarily contains memos and interdepartmental correspondence that discuss appointments for faculty and staff, as well as curriculum issues. Several of the folders contain committee meeting minutes and agendas that address curriculum matters, such as potential new courses as well as changes to current courses. The sub-series also includes some correspondence between the English department and various IU administrative offices. The <emph render="bold">General subject sub-series, 1943-2012, </emph> contain records on a wide variety of issues that pertain to the growth and development of the English Department, mainly in the 1950s and 1960s. The sub-series contains interdepartmental correspondence along with memoranda with select IU administrative offices regarding curriculum matters and course offerings. Some folders contain reports pertaining to curriculum matters, such as course proposals and alterations, while other folders relate to more administrative affairs, such as problems with graduate examinations and teaching load requirements. Also found here are files on the history of the department, gathered as part of project in the late 1960s. Included in the files are memoirs and reminiscences of faculty and alumni from acros the years. The series also includes some funding requests for various projects the department sought to develop. The <emph render="bold"> Programs sub-series, 1956-1976, </emph>mainly consists of interdepartmental correspondence on the various programs that the English department pursued and developed. Most of the folders contain memos that discuss proposals and funding requests for the programs. Unlike the other folders in this series, the comparative literature program file consists mostly of course and curriculum information documenting the debates among faculty and administrative officials on how best to develop the program. The sub-series, <emph render="bold">Regional campuses, 1964-1972, </emph>is comprised of correspondence between the English department at IU and the English departments at other IU campuses. Since Bloomington's English department served as a guide for the development and growth of other the other departments, the correspondence primarily pertains to faculty issues, such as faculty openings and potential candidates to fill the new positions. Also, various memoranda discuss the types of courses the branch campuses offered and the recommendations for making changes in curriculums.</p><p> The final series, the Publications series, 1943-2012, consists primarily of departmental newsletters and its working papers but also includes other departmental publications such as The Ballantinian, The Folio, Pegasus, Quarry, and departmental manuals.</p>  </scopecontent>
