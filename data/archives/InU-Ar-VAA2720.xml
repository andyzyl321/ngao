    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>This collection contains the personal papers of James Woodburn, Theophilus Wylie Woodburn, Caroline Gelston Woodburn, James Gelston Woodburn, and Janet Woodburn Wiecking. All are family members of <emph render="bold">James Albert Woodburn,</emph> a historian and distinguished member of the Indiana University faculty from 1890-1938. </p><p> <emph render="bold">James Woodburn, 1817-1865,</emph> patriarch of the family and the father of James A. Woodburn, was born in Chester County, South Carolina. At thirteen he moved with his family to Monroe County, Indiana, in 1830 in a migration of "Covenanters" and Associate Reformed Presbyterians who opposed slavery. He received his A.B. degree from Indiana University in 1842 and his A.M. degree in 1845. From 1839 to 1844 he taught in the rural schools of Monroe County, attended college and in 1843 taught in Greene County, Ohio. From 1844-1853 he was a teacher in the Bloomington, Indiana, schools and from 1853 to his death in 1865 was principal of the Preparatory Department of Indiana University. James Woodburn married Martha Jane Hemphill in 1846. They had six children, including James Albert Woodburn and Theophilus Wylie Woodburn. (Some material condensed from Lilly Library entry at http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/lilly/mss/html/woodburn.html#xtocid2283170.)</p><p> <emph render="bold">Theophilus Wylie Woodburn, 1852-1912,</emph> the brother of James A. Woodburn, was born in Bloomington, Indiana. Upon his father's death, he went to work as a printer while still a boy, starting at the "Republican Progress" in Bloomington. In 1876 he moved to Minnesota and spent most of his life in the small towns of Atwater and Benson as a publisher and editor.</p><p> <emph render="bold">Caroline Louise Gelston Woodburn, 1866-1943,</emph> was born in Rushville, New York, the daughter of Caroline Fanning Gelston and Rev. Mills B. Gelston, a Presbyterian minister. The family moved to Ann Arbor Michigan when Caroline was ten years old. She graduated from the University of Michigan, Department of Literature, Science and the Arts in 1888 and became a teacher at Battle Creek High School from 1888-1889. She had an instructorship in Greek and Latin at Wellesley College for academic years1889-1890 and 1891-1892 and then moved to Indianapolis to teach Greek and Latin at the Girls Classical School founded by suffragette May Wright Sewall. While teaching in Indianapolis she met James Albert Woodburn, who had come to lecture at the University Extension division. They married in Ann Arbor in 1893 and moved to Bloomington, Indiana. She described herself as a homemaker, but was always interested and active in progressive movements for women, including forming the Women's League in Bloomington. After the sudden death of Louise Goodbody, Dean of Women, in March 1911, she served as advisor to Indiana University students for the remainder of that spring semester. The Woodburns had three children: Janet McMillan Woodburn, James Gelston Woodburn and Albert Edward Woodburn, who died in infancy. Upon Professor Woodburn's retirement in 1938, the Woodburn's moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Mrs. Woodburn died in 1943. Additional material can be found in the "Gelston family papers, 1847-1917" at the University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library.</p><p> <emph render="bold">James Gelston Woodburn, 1894-1980,</emph> son of James Albert and Caroline Gelston Woodburn, was born in Bloomington, Indiana. He received his A.B. and A. M. degrees in mathematics from Indiana University in 1915 and 1916 respectively. He completed his B.S. degree in civil engineering from Purdue University in 1918 and his Ph.D. in civil engineering from the University of Michigan in 1929. He married Delma Donald in 1923 and the couple had two sons: James Donald Woodburn, born in 1925 and Robert Donald Woodburn, born in 1928, both of whom became engineers. (See Delma's Biography at http://www.mounthoreb.org/PT2_02Delma.html.) He taught civil and hydraulic engineering at Washington State University in Pullman from 1923 to 1926 and from 1930 to 1937. He also was Professor of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of Wisconsin from 1937 until his retirement in 1965. He joined Horace W. King and Chester O. Wisler as a co-author for the fourth and fifth editions of their well-regarded engineering text, Hydraulics, in 1941, which was republished in its fifth edition in 1980. He died in Madison, Wisconsin in 1980.</p><p> <emph render="bold">Janet McMillan Woodburn Wiecking, 1900-1980,</emph> daughter of James Albert and Caroline Gelston Woodburn, was born in Bloomington, Indiana in 1900. She received her A.B. from Indiana University in 1922 and her A. M. from Radcliffe College, both in history. She continued advanced studies at Columbia University. In 1930 she married Ernst Hermann Wiecking, who was associated with the U. S. Department of Agriculture for many years. They had one son, David K. Wiecking. Janet Woodburn Wiecking died in 1980 in Alexandria, Virginia. Additional Correspondence of Janet Wiecking and her husband, Ernst Hermann Wiecking, can be found in IU Archives Collection 69, the William Lowe Bryan papers, 1830-1956, and Collection 46, the Charlotte Lowe Bryan papers, 1873-1948.</p>  </bioghist>
