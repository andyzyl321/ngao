    <abstract id="aspace_bc47bc6f3f2254e30edafa48949f37bf">Established as the Regional Economic Development Institute in 1984, the Indiana University Institute for Development Strategies is a university-wide program that focuses on research to promote economic development, and in particular the links between globalization, entrepreneurship, and the strategic management of regions to promote economic development. Directors of the Institute have included Charles Bonser, 1988-1997, and David Audretsch, appointed in 1998. Bonser also served as the first endowed Chair of the Ameritech Fellowship Program, which was established with a grant from the Ameritech Foundation. Research projects funded by this grant targeted major issues related to the new and emerging economies of mature economic regions with emphasis placed on the American Midwest. This collection consists of correspondence, research proposals and reports, publications, annual reports, working papers, committee files, conference and workshop information, and project records. Prominent in the collection is the Director's correspondence series, organized into two sub-series by incumbent, and records relating to the research projects funded by the Institute. The collection also includes files related to the establishment of the Institute, located in the Administration series.</abstract>

    <head>Administrative History</head>
<p>In 1984, the Research and Graduate Development Office and the School for Public and Environmental Affairs established the Regional Economic Development Institute (REDI) "to foster a multidisciplinary dialogue on regional development among faculty, students and outside scholars and practitioners who have research and implementation interests in this topic from both the domestic and international perspectives" and for "applied research, training, intellectual exchange including conference organization and participation" (from the Application for Research Institute or Center Status). According to the Institute's website, it is a university-wide research program pulling together faculty from various departments and campuses and matching them with outside research projects being undertaken in the United States and around the world. The Institute is particularly interested in "the links between globalization, entrepreneurship, and the strategic management of regions to promote economic development."</p><p> In 1988, Charles Bonser became director of the Institute and changed the name from the Regional Economic Development Institute to the Institute for Development Strategies (IDS). For Bonser this name better fit the scope of the Institute's work, since its work included economic development at local, regional, national, and international levels. </p><p> In 1992, Bonser was appointed as the first endowed Chair of the Ameritech Fellowship Program . The Ameritech Endowed Chair in Economic Development was a $1.2 million grant given to IU in 1992 by the Ameritech Foundation. Over five years, $500,000 was given by the Institute to support the research of 35 faculty members into issues related to economic development in economically mature regions, the main focus being on the economy of the American Midwest. Bonser served as chair until 1997, and continued as IDS director until 1998. In 1998, David Audretsch became the IDS director and the Chair of the Ameritech Fellowship Program, positions he still holds.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Institute for Development Strategies records, 1979-2003, are organized into ten series: Administration; Ameritech Foundation; Committees and panels; Conferences; Director's correspondence; Graduate programs in Europe; National Academy of Public Administration; Non-governmental organizations/private volunteer organizations (NGOs/PVOs); Projects; Publications; and Research.</p><p> The Administration series, 1979-1998, consists of material on the founding, organization, and administration of the Institute for Development Strategies. It is further organized into two sub-series, Foundations and Regional Economic Development Institute. The Foundations sub-series includes material on the work done with foundations donating money to academic and intellectual institutions for research. It is arranged alphabetically by each foundation's name. The sub-series Regional Economic Development Institute consists of materials relating to the establishment of the Institute. It includes a mission statement, the Institute's Application for Institute or Center Status, and the documents submitted to the IU Board of Trustees for the name change from the Regional Economic Development Institute to the Institute for Development Strategies.</p><p> The Ameritech Foundation series consists of materials related to the administration of the $1.2 million research grant the Foundation awarded the IDS. Included in the records is information on the purpose and news releases announcing the award. The sub-series Ameritech Endowed Chair search is closed to researchers because it includes material from applicant interviews, resumes, financial records, correspondence between applicants and search committee members, as well as correspondence between committee members on the qualifications of the candidates. This sub-series also includes the position announcement, search letters mailed to possible applicants, and records concerning the appointment of Charles Bonser as the first chair. The sub-series Proposals consists of applications for Ameritech grant money and includes files on both approved and unfunded projects. The Reports sub-series contains materials about the projects funded through the Ameritech grant, financial matters, publication guidelines, Foundation annual reports, completed research projects, as well as a report on the IU Research Exposition. The Working papers sub-series is the largest in the Ameritech Foundation series. Included are sales records, arranged chronologically, containing materials such as sales receipts, cancelled checks, and requests for the purchase of the final reports of completed projects funded by the Ameritech Foundation.. The reports themselves are arranged alphabetically by title. The last sub-series, Workshops, is arranged chronologically. The workshops, funded by the Ameritech grant, were held between 1988 and 1998.</p><p> Committees and panels, 1990-1996, the third series, consists of only five files and is arranged alphabetically. These groups were composed of faculty members from IU, members of the Institute, and also members and faculty of other institutes and universities. These committees and panels met to deal with university policies, such as curriculum, public policies, and with issues related to the activities of the IDS.</p><p> The series Conferences, 1989-2001, is arranged alphabetically into sub-series by the conference title. Each sub-series includes program schedules, participant and speaker information, conference expenses, hotel accommodations and services, and correspondence related to the conference.</p><p> The Director's correspondence series, 1997-2001, includes the letters of the Institute's first director, Charles Bonser, and the second and current director, David Audretsch. These two sub-series are arranged alphabetically and then chronologically.</p><p> The next series, Graduate programs in Europe, 1996-2001, includes information on study abroad programs for IU graduate students, and address such topics as economic development, globalization, and public administration. There are four sub-series - European Globalization Perspectives; Globalization in Europe; Law, Public Policy, and Commerce in the European Union; and the Paris Program – and files within each sub-series are arranged alphabetically. Included in each sub-series are student information, course descriptions, expenses, program schedules, course readings, correspondence, and course evaluations. </p><p> The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) series, 1997-2001, consists of biographies and mailing lists on members, or Academy Fellows, of the organization. There is also general information on NAPA that includes newsletters, director and fellow election information and some correspondence. These files are arranged alphabetically.</p><p> The next series, Non-Governmental Organizations/Private Volunteer Organizations (NGOs/PVOs), 1978-1992, is arranged alphabetically. This series includes a large amount of information on research undertaken and conferences organized by non-governmental organizations and private volunteer organizations. The two major conferences are arranged into two sub-series, the Brussels meeting and the Kuala Lumpur seminar. The Brussels meeting was a project on the roles and effectiveness of NGOs and PVOs done in cooperation with the International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS) of Brussels, Belgium. American involvement was sponsored by the U.S. State Department. The Kuala Lumpur seminar was also organized by the IIAS and the Asian and Pacific Development Center to examine the role of NGOs in national development. There is also a chronologically arranged sub-series of general correspondence, and an alphabetically arranged sub-series of proposals for research projects on the subject of NGOs and PVOs.</p><p> The eighth series, Projects, 1991-1995, is arranged alphabetically by project titles. One of the objectives of the IDS is intellectual exchange with other academic and research institutes in the local community, the country and the world. These projects include a development plan for Bloomington and Monroe County, applied research into the development needs in all of North America, and a variety of projects undertaken at universities in Cairo and Asia. </p><p> The next series, Publications, 1990-2001, is arranged alphabetically by publication title. There are three publications included in this series, two books and one article. The first book is titled American Public Policy Problems: An Introductory Guide and was authored by IDS director Charles Bonser, along with Eugene McGregor, Jr. and Clinton Oster, Jr. The folders in this sub-series are arranged by chapter. The second book, Globalization and Regionalization, by IDS directors Charles Bonser and David Audretsch, is organized by the editing stage of the manuscript. This sub-series also includes a file of correspondence and contracts related to the publication of this book. The one article included in this series, "Total Quality Education," is an article by Charles Bonser published in the September/October 1992 issue of Public Administration Review. The files in this sub-series are arranged alphabetically and include brief descriptions and drafts of the article, as well as correspondence and related articles.</p><p> The final series, Research, is arranged alphabetically into three sub-series, Grant recipients, Proposals, and Reports. The Grant recipients' files are arranged alphabetically by surname. If there is more than one researcher credited, the folders are filed according to the primary researcher – usually the name that appears first on the reports, proposals and other documents included in the file. The Proposals sub-series is arranged alphabetically by project title. These are the first stage, or first ideas presented, for research projects. In the original accession, these were filed separately from the proposals in the Ameritech Foundation proposals because they were not for research projects to be funded by the Ameritech grant money. The Reports sub-series is arranged alphabetically by report title. These files include several articles that were either written for a conference or pertained to the conference's topic. These reports are arranged according to conference title. Again, in the original accession these reports were separated from the Ameritech research reports because they were funded by other institutions and grant monies.</p>  </scopecontent>
